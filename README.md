# Week 7 - Workshop 3 - Session Management

## !WORK IN PROGRESS!

__Learning Outcomes__

- what is cookie signing/encryption
- jwts or JSON cookies
- secure routing (maybe)

__npm packages__
- [cookie-signature](http://npmjs.com/package/cookie-signature)
- [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)

__Exercises__

- read docs for cookie/jwt/whatever and implement that as a middleware

---

### Advanced payloads
Signing or encrypting the cookie payload value, or json. [What is encryption?]

### JWTs
[this section will be either JWT or encrypted JSON based]

### Cookie middleware implementation
[this will probably involve remixing a project on [glitch](https://glitch.com/) that already has working routes but needs the cookie/JWT middleware to secure them, and pass user information]
